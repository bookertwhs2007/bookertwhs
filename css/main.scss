// ITCSS + BEM naming

// settings - used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
@import "settings/colors";
@import "settings/typography";

// tools - globally used mixins and functions. Itâ€™s important not to output any
// CSS in the first 2 layers.
@import "tools/grid";

// generic - reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is
// the first layer which generates actual CSS.
@import "generic/box-sizing";

// elements - styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with
// default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.

// objects - class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for
// example media object known from OOCSS.

// components - specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes
// place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components.
@import "components/header";
@import "components/footer";
@import "components/section";

// trumps - utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which
// goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
