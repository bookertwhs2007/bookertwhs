## 10-Year Reunion!

**Friday, May 12**
Join us for a bar crawl downtown! We're teaming up with various bars/restaurants to offer discounts just for our class. Stay tuned for more details!

### If you work at a place downtown and would be willing to offer a discount as part of our bar crawl, please email us at <bookertwhs.2007@gmail.com>!

**Saturday, May 13**
During the day, head to the beach or hit up some of the new restaurants or bars that have opened recently. We may offer a photo scavenger hunt with prizes, as well. Stay tuned for more details!

**THE MAIN EVENT! Saturday, May 13**
We'll take over Phineas Phogg's (a.k.a. The Boom Boom Room) at Seville Quarter from 6-10 p.m. The DJ will be playing all of the hits from 2004-2007. Make sure you stop by the photo booth to take a few pictures with some cute props. We'll have an assortment of heavy hor d'oeuvres & the bartenders will be serving up drinks (the first one's on us; then, cash bar). Feel free to stay out and mingle with friends at Seville after the event ends! 

PLEASE NOTE: One date per classmate may attend. Those who did not graduate with the BTWHS class of 2007 are allowed to attend, but they must be registered as the date of a classmate. Children and others under 18 are not permitted to this event.

### Submit your then & now photos to have them included in our slideshow... Just email them to us at <bookertwhs.2007@gmail.com> by March 30!

**Sunday, May 14**
We chose this weekend so out-of-towners will be home to spend time with their families on Mother's Day, if they so choose! :)
