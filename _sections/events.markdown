## 10-Year Reunion!

**Friday, May 12**
We'd love everyone to join us at World of Beer & Blend for a meet-up Friday night from 7-11. No tickets required, but you must have a wristband to get the drink discounts. It will be a cash bar, but they are giving us half-off beers, $3 well drinks, $4 Stoli drinks and $4 Jack drinks. We'll also have koozies for sale for $5!

**Saturday, May 13**
We'll have a tour of the school led by current SGA members. Come by for coffee and Otist cookies at THE CAT SHACK, then take a trip down memory lane. They'll also be selling shirts, hats and other gear!

**Saturday, May 13 - THE MAIN EVENT!**
We'll take over Phineas Phogg's (a.k.a. The Boom Boom Room) at Seville Quarter from 6-10 p.m. The DJ will be playing all of the hits from 2004-2007. Make sure you stop by the photo booth to take a few pictures with some cute props. We'll have an assortment of heavy hor d'oeuvres & the bartenders will be serving up drinks (the first one's on us; then, cash bar). Feel free to stay out and mingle with friends at Seville after the event ends!

We chose this weekend so out-of-towners will be home to spend time with their families on Mother's Day, if they so choose! :)
